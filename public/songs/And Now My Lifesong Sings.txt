When God’s hand of grace extends to us – the unearned and
undeserved hand of grace – all we have left to do is worship.
Not as debtors who could ever begin to repay our Father, but as
children who merely respond to Him with our lives. Our new
and everlasting lives.

AND NOW MY LIFESONG SINGS
MARK HALL 

I once was lost, but now I’m found
I once was lost, but now I’m found
So far away, but I’m home now
I once was lost, but now I’m found
And now my lifesong sings 

I once was blind, but now I see
I once was blind, but now I see
I don’t know how, but when He touched me
I once was blind, but now I see 
And now my lifesong sings
And now my lifesong sings
And now my lifesong sings 

I once was dead, but now I live
I once was dead, but now I live
Now my life to You I give
Now my life to You I give
Now my life to You I give 

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Let my lifesong sing to You
